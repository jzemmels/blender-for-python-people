# 🌀 Blender Python Mini-Course

Welcome to the **Blender Python Mini-Course**!  
This beginner-friendly, project-based course is designed for developers with **intermediate Python skills** who want to learn Blender through scripting first — and build up visual, manual intuition along the way.

> ✅ No prior Blender experience required.  
> ✅ Python-first approach with interactive scripting exercises.  
> ✅ Manual UI exploration prompts included to build interface fluency.

## 🧠 Learning Goals

Each lesson is project-driven and includes:

- 🧩 **Templated Scripts** — You fill in the code to generate 3D content.
- 🔎 **Exploration Prompts** — Learn through experimentation.
- 🖱️ **Manual Interface Guides** — Understand where changes show up in Blender.
- 🚀 **Challenge Exercises** — Take it further and deepen your understanding.
- 📚 **Linked Resources** — Read official docs or tutorials for each concept.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Step 1: Install Blender

Download the latest stable release from:  
👉 [https://www.blender.org/download/](https://www.blender.org/download/)

No installation of Python is necessary — Blender ships with its own interpreter.

---

### 🐍 Step 2: Open and Run a Python Script in Blender

1. Launch **Blender** and start a new **General** project.
2. Click the **Scripting** tab at the top of the Blender interface.
3. In the **Text Editor** panel, click `Open` and choose any `.py` file from one of the lesson folders.
4. Click **Run Script** (play button or `Alt+P`).

✨ Your script will execute — and you’ll see the result in the 3D Viewport!
