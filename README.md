# Blender for Python People 🐍🎨

Welcome to **Blender for Python People**, a beginner-friendly mini-course for learning Blender through Python scripting first — and the UI second.

This course helps Python programmers explore Blender’s creative world by writing code and gradually understanding how that code connects to the Blender interface.

## 💡 What You’ll Learn

- Core 3D concepts (objects, transforms, scenes)
- Blender’s Python API (`bpy`)
- How to script geometry, lighting, and camera setups
- Creating your own custom panels and add-ons

Each module includes:
