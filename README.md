## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Step 1: Install Blender

Download the latest stable release from:  
👉 [https://www.blender.org/download/](https://www.blender.org/download/)

No installation of Python is necessary — Blender ships with its own interpreter.

### 🐍 Step 2: Open and Run a Python Script in Blender

1. Launch **Blender** and start a new **General** project.
2. Click the **Scripting** tab at the top of the Blender interface.
3. In the **Text Editor** panel, click `Open` and choose any `.py` file from one of the lesson folders.
4. Click **Run Script** (play button or `Alt+P`).

✨ Your script will execute — and you’ll see the result in the 3D Viewport!
