# Manual Instructions: Scene Assistant Panel

1. Manually build the scene:
   - Delete everything: `A` → `X`
   - Add floor: `Shift + A` → Mesh → Plane → Size: 10
   - Add light: `Shift + A` → Light → Sun → Location: `(5, 5, 5)`
   - Add camera: `Shift + A` → Camera → Location: `(7, -7, 5)`
   - Set camera rotation:
     - X: `1.1`
     - Y: `0`
     - Z: `0.78`

2. To use the panel:
   - Paste and run the script in `main.py`
   - Sidebar (`N`) → “Tools” tab → Click “Setup Simple Scene”

3. This mimics a one-click layout for common lighting + camera presets.
